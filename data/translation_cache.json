      "text": "The invention relates to the field of thermonuclear fusion and can be used in devices for fastening a blanket module to the vacuum vessel of a fusion reactor. A device for fastening a blanket module to a fusion reactor vacuum vessel includes a support comprising flexible rod elements arranged in the form of a bundle between two flanges, in the central portion of the flanges. The support is connected by one flange to the blanket module and is mounted via the other flange in a threaded mounting seat in the vacuum vessel, wherein the support is connected to the seat by a threaded connection via a resilient clamping sleeve. The resilient clamping sleeve is mounted on the support such as to provide contact with the inner surface of the support flange facing the vacuum vessel. The diameter of the support flange facing the vacuum vessel and the diameter of the mounting seat are selected such that a radial compensating gap is formed between the flange and the mounting seat during mounting. The technical result of the present invention is that of providing plan view dual-axis tolerance during the installation of a blanket module on a vacuum vessel under the restricted conditions arising from the position of the mounting seat on the vacuum vessel by reducing the transverse dimension (in plan view) of the device and allowing free radial movement during the mounting of the support flange in the mounting seat in the fusion reactor vacuum vessel (prior to tightening).",
